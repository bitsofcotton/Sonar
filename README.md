# Sonar
Stub of planning project.

Get structure from multiple of placed intensity sensors.

# Tips
If we have better x-ray intensity on some sphere, we can get inner structures.
So analogy to this, can we have diversity on high frequency sound data on some sphere
(supposing sphere wave on each.) into some internal state??
And what the invert between inner space and outer space on the domain?
